### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Prashant Singh, a decision scientist with 3+ years of experience in the same domain. I'm currently working with Axtria to build healthcare analytics products.I've always loved thinking, tinkering with things, and exploring new tools to create with. I really enjoy building with logic and have been fascinated with technology since I've realized the importance of tech in solving problems. I love how programming enables people to quickly explore new ideas and I've found that the most efficient and fun way for me to learn is to learn by doing things. I have authored various projects on Image analysis, computational math, deep learning & analytics. Besides engaging myself in side projects, listening music & watching movies is something I'd like to do. Also, I like to read & some of my favorite authors are Franz Kafka,  J.P Sartre, Camus.

If you want to know more about me, what I'm up to or if you're just feeling social - feel free to get in touch, I would love to hear from you.
