### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Prashant Singh, a machine learning professional with 1+ years of experience in the same domain. I'm currently pursuing post-graduation in data science & artificial intelligence.I've always loved thinking, tinkering with things, and exploring new tools to create with. I really enjoy building with logic and have been fascinated with technology since I've realized the importance of tech in solving problems. I love how programming enables people to quickly explore new ideas and I've found that the most efficient and fun way for me to learn is to explore different dimensions of the STEM landscape in small side projects in parallel to my studies and current employment. I have authored various projects on Image analysis, computational math, deep learning & analytics. Besides engaging myself in side projects, hanging out with friends and studying, I read a lot, especially philosophy. Some of my favorite authors are Franz Kafka, Nietzsche, J.P Sartre, Camus & I also do listen to my favorite band AC/DC.

If you want to know more about me, what I'm up to or if you're just feeling social - feel free to get in touch, I would love to hear from you & you can also browse my website.
